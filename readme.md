This is my emacs config, backed up to github for easy deployment to any
new machines.

# Requirments

- [texlive](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/texlive-bin/)
  and
  [texlive-latexextra](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/texlive-latexextra/)
  or your environment's equivalent
- [nerd fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts), specifically
  'Victor Mono'
- [cmake](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cmake/)

I believe that is all for it to work.

# Installation

Just drop the ./emacs file into ./config. Straight should bootstrap
itself and install all the packages.
