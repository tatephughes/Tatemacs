# Tate's Emacs Config

Dropping this for the future when I need to quickly get my emacs config back. Should mostly be drop and go, besides other things to install (LaTeX, python, sbt etc.) Also, you will need to install the fonts (Jetbrains mono and Ubuntu I believe) and the icons from all-the-icons (i believe it is a command within emacs).
