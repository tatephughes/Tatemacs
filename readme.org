#+TITLE: Tatemacs

This is my emacs config, backed up to github for easy deployment to any new machines.

* Requirments
- [[https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/texlive-bin/][texlive]] and [[https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/any/texlive-latexextra/][texlive-latexextra]] or your environment's equivalent
- [[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts][nerd fonts]], specifically 'Victor Mono'
- [[https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/cmake/][cmake]]

I believe that is all for it to work.

* Installation

Just drop the ~./emacs~ file into ~~.config/~. Straight should bootstrap itself and install all the packages.
